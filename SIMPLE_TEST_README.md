# 🧪 Simple Test for Renaissance Weekly

## The Easiest Way to Test Your System

I've created a **super simple test** that checks if your Renaissance Weekly system is working correctly.

## How to Run It

Just one command:

```bash
python simple_test.py
```

That's it! No pytest, no complex commands, no confusion.

## What It Tests

The test checks 5 basic things:

1. **Can we create an Episode?** - Tests the basic data model
2. **Can we create a database?** - Tests database setup
3. **Can we save and retrieve episodes?** - Tests database operations
4. **Can we filter by date?** - Tests date filtering logic
5. **Can we load the podcast list?** - Tests configuration

## What You'll See
