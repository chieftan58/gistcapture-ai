# Summary of Changes to Fix 80% Failure Rate

## Problem
Only 7 out of 35 episodes (20%) were included in the final email because the transcript validation was too strict for 5-minute test mode audio clips.

## Root Cause
The validator required >10 conversation indicators in the first 100 lines, which 5-minute clips couldn't achieve despite meeting length requirements.

## Changes Made to `renaissance_weekly/processing/summarizer.py`

### 1. Adjusted Conversation Indicator Threshold
- **Before**: Required >10 conversation indicators
- **After**: Requires ≥3 indicators in test mode, ≥10 in production
- **Impact**: Allows 5-minute clips with fewer conversation patterns to pass

### 2. Relaxed Metadata Ratio Check
- **Before**: Rejected if >30% metadata in first 50 lines
- **After**: Allows up to 50% metadata in test mode
- **Impact**: Accommodates intro-heavy 5-minute clips

### 3. Added Special Handling for Test Mode Audio
- **New**: Very lenient validation for audio transcriptions in test mode
- **Requirements**: ≥300 words, ≥1500 chars, ≥1 conversation indicator
- **Impact**: Ensures 5-minute audio clips aren't unfairly rejected

### 4. Enhanced Debug Logging
- **Added**: Detailed validation metrics logged before failures
- **Shows**: Word count, char count, conversation indicators, metadata ratio, URL count
- **Impact**: Makes it easier to diagnose any remaining failures

## Expected Results
- **Before**: 7/35 episodes succeeded (20%)
- **After**: ~30/35 episodes should succeed (85%+)

## To Test
Run the same command again:
```bash
python main.py
```

The system should now successfully process most episodes, with only legitimate failures (no transcript sources, download failures) being rejected.

## Note
These changes only affect test mode behavior. Production mode validation remains strict to ensure high-quality summaries.
