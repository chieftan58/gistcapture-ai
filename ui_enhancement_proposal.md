# Renaissance Weekly UI Enhancement Proposal

## Overview
Enhanced single-tab UI flow with seamless transitions between states, maintaining the existing minimalist design aesthetic.

## State Flow Diagram
```
[Podcast Selection] 
    ↓
[Episode Selection]
    ↓
[Cost & Time Estimate] ← NEW
    ↓
[Processing Progress] ← NEW (with cancel ability)
    ↓
[Results Summary] ← NEW
    ↓
[Email Approval] ← NEW
    ↓
[Complete]
```

## Key Features

### 1. Cost & Time Estimate (New State)
- Display after episode selection, before processing
- Shows:
  - Total episodes: X
  - Transcription mode: Test/Full
  - Estimated cost: $X.XX
  - Estimated time: X minutes
  - Breakdown by operation type
- Actions: "Start Processing" / "Go Back"

### 2. Processing Progress (Enhanced)
- Real-time updates via WebSocket or polling
- Shows:
  - Overall progress bar
  - Current episode being processed
  - Live success/failure counters
  - Failed episodes listed immediately
  - Time elapsed / Time remaining
  - Current operation (fetching/transcribing/summarizing)
- Actions: "Cancel Processing" (prominent red button)

### 3. Results Summary (New State)
- Post-processing summary
- Shows:
  - Success rate visualization
  - List of successful episodes
  - List of failed episodes with error reasons
  - Total processing time
  - Total cost incurred
- Actions: "Continue to Email" / "Retry Failed" / "Cancel"

### 4. Email Approval (New State)
- Final confirmation before sending
- Shows:
  - Email preview (first few lines)
  - Recipient count
  - Episode count in digest
  - Warning if any episodes failed
- Actions: "Send Email" / "Cancel"

## Implementation Details

### Backend Changes Needed:
1. Add `/api/estimate-cost` endpoint
2. Add `/api/processing-status` endpoint for real-time updates
3. Add `/api/cancel-processing` endpoint
4. Add `/api/email-preview` endpoint
5. Modify processing to support cancellation

### Frontend Enhancements:
1. Add new render functions for each state
2. Add WebSocket or polling for real-time updates
3. Add state transitions with smooth animations
4. Maintain existing CSS design system

### State Management:
```javascript
const APP_STATE = {
    state: 'podcast_selection', // Add new states
    selectedPodcasts: new Set(),
    selectedEpisodes: new Set(),
    processingStatus: {
        total: 0,
        completed: 0,
        failed: 0,
        current: null,
        startTime: null,
        errors: []
    },
    costEstimate: {
        episodes: 0,
        estimatedCost: 0,
        estimatedTime: 0,
        breakdown: {}
    },
    emailPreview: null
};
```

## Benefits:
1. **Transparency**: Users see costs and time before committing
2. **Control**: Can cancel at any time if too many failures
3. **Confidence**: Email approval prevents accidental sends
4. **Visibility**: Real-time progress reduces anxiety
5. **Recovery**: Can retry failed episodes selectively

## Minimal Code Changes:
- Extends existing single-page architecture
- Reuses existing CSS and design patterns
- Adds states without changing core flow
- Progressive enhancement approach
