# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

Renaissance Weekly is a Python-based podcast intelligence system that automatically fetches, transcribes, and summarizes episodes from 19 curated podcasts, then sends email digests via SendGrid.

## Key Commands

### Running the Application
```bash
# Process last N days of episodes (default: 7)
python main.py [days]

# Run verification report
python main.py verify [days]

# Check single podcast
python main.py check "Podcast Name" [days]

# Reload prompts for A/B testing
python main.py reload-prompts

# Force regenerate summaries with current prompt
python main.py regenerate-summaries [days]

# Run system diagnostics
python main.py test
```

### Testing Commands
```bash
# Test only episode fetching
python main.py --test-fetch [days]

# Test summarization with a transcript file
python main.py --test-summarize <transcript_file>

# Test email generation with cached data
python main.py --test-email

# Run full pipeline without API calls
python main.py --dry-run [days]

# Save current cache as test dataset
python main.py --save-dataset <name>

# Load test dataset into cache
python main.py --load-dataset <name>
```

### Development Setup
```bash
# Install system dependencies
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get install -y ffmpeg

# Install Python dependencies
pip install -e .

# Create .env file with required API keys:
# OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
# SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_key
# OPENAI_MODEL=gpt-4o (optional)
# OPENAI_TEMPERATURE=0.3 (optional)
# OPENAI_MAX_TOKENS=4000 (optional)
```

## Architecture

### Core Flow
1. **Fetching**: Retrieves episodes from RSS feeds and Apple Podcasts API
2. **Transcript Finding**: Multi-source approach (RSS, web scraping, APIs, audio transcription)
3. **Summarization**: Uses OpenAI GPT-4 to create executive summaries
4. **Email Delivery**: Sends HTML digests via SendGrid

### Key Directories
- `/renaissance_weekly/` - Main application package
  - `app.py` - Core application with resource-aware concurrency
  - `config.py` - Configuration management
  - `database.py` - SQLite database operations
  - `/email/` - Email generation and sending
  - `/fetchers/` - Episode fetching logic
  - `/transcripts/` - Transcript finding and generation
  - `/processing/` - AI-powered summarization
  - `/ui/` - Web-based episode selection

### Important Files
- `podcasts.yaml` - List of 19 monitored podcasts
- `prompts/summary_prompt.txt` - AI summarization instructions (dynamic headers)
- `prompts/system_prompt.txt` - System prompt for AI context
- `renaissance_weekly.db` - SQLite database (auto-created)
- `requirements.txt` - Python package dependencies (fixed)

## Key Technical Details

### Rate Limiting
The system includes built-in OpenAI API rate limiting with exponential backoff and circuit breaker pattern for 100% reliability.

### Concurrency
Resource-aware concurrency adapts to available CPU/memory for optimal performance.

### Error Handling
Comprehensive exception aggregation and reporting ensures visibility into failures.

### Database Schema
Episodes are tracked with status (pending, transcribed, summarized, emailed) and transcript sources.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Podcast
1. Add entry to `podcasts.yaml` with RSS feed and Apple Podcast ID
2. Run `python main.py 30` to fetch recent episodes

### Debugging Failed Episodes
1. Check `renaissance_weekly.log` for errors
2. Run `python main.py verify` to see processing status
3. Use `python main.py check "Podcast Name"` for specific podcast issues

### Testing Summarization
Set `TESTING_MODE=true` to limit audio transcription to 15 minutes for faster testing (provides more content for better summaries while still being quick).

### Full Episode Processing
The UI now includes a Test/Full mode selector:
- **Test Mode**: 15-minute clips, ~$0.10 per episode, fast processing
- **Full Mode**: Complete episodes with:
  - Automatic audio chunking for files >25MB
  - Cost: ~$0.50-1.50 per episode (depending on length)
  - Time: ~5-10 minutes per episode (due to Whisper API rate limits)
  - Higher memory requirements (1.5GB per concurrent task)

## Important Notes

- The project directory name (`gistcapture-ai`) differs from the package name (`renaissance-weekly`).
- No test suite exists currently - be careful when making changes.
- Summary caching: Summaries are cached to disk. If you update `prompts/summary_prompt.txt`, use `python main.py regenerate-summaries` to force regeneration.
- Audio downloads may fail with 403 errors on some platforms. The system has multiple fallback strategies including platform-specific headers and yt-dlp.
- Test datasets can be saved/loaded to speed up development cycles without re-downloading content.

## Enhanced Reliability Features

### Multi-Layer Transcript Finding
The system now searches for transcripts in this order:
1. Database cache
2. RSS feed transcript URLs
3. Podcast Index API
4. Podcast-specific scrapers (Tim Ferriss blog, Substack)
5. YouTube transcripts
6. Web page scraping
7. Audio transcription (last resort)

### Robust Audio Download
- Platform-specific strategies for major podcast hosts
- yt-dlp integration with browser cookie extraction (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Multiple retry strategies with exponential backoff
- Comprehensive file validation

### System Monitoring
- Run `python main.py health` to see system health report
- Tracks success/failure rates by component and podcast
- Identifies problematic podcasts
- Persistent monitoring data between runs

### API Integrations
- **YouTube API**: Set `YOUTUBE_API_KEY` in .env for better YouTube search
- **Podcast Index API**: Set `PODCASTINDEX_API_KEY` and `PODCASTINDEX_API_SECRET` for transcript discovery
- Get free API keys at:
  - YouTube: https://console.cloud.google.com/
  - Podcast Index: https://api.podcastindex.org/

- **Processing thread integration**: The UI now triggers real processing with proper error handling

### Recent Updates (2025-01-03) - Fixed RSS Feed Fetching Issues:
- **Fixed hanging on large RSS feeds (Tim Ferriss, Odd Lots, Market Huddle)**:
  - Previous complex streaming logic was causing more problems than it solved
  - Reverted to simple approach with universal 5MB size limit
  - All feeds now use streaming download with max 5MB (enough for recent episodes)
  - Removed special handling for specific domains - one approach for all feeds
  
- **Key improvements**:
  - Universal streaming with 5MB limit prevents memory issues and timeouts
  - Recent episodes are at the beginning of RSS feeds, so 5MB is sufficient
  - Simplified code with no special cases = fewer bugs
  - Fixed feedparser timeout increased from 10s to 20s for large feed parsing

  - Shows which podcasts were checked but had no recent content

- **Fixed Email Sending After Approval**:
  - Changed completion message from "Processing X episodes..." to "Sending email digest to [email]..."
  - UI now passes `email_approved` flag and `final_summaries` to avoid re-processing
  - App detects email approval and sends immediately without duplicate processing
  - Email actually sends now instead of just closing the window

- **Code Quality**:
  - Fixed invalid escape sequences (changed `\$` to `$` in f-strings)
  - Added EMAIL_TO import for proper email display
  - Improved thread safety and error handling

### Recent Updates (2025-01-03) - Latest Fixes:
- **Updated CLAUDE.md**: Added comprehensive documentation of all recent updates and fixes
- **Tracking Modified Files**: Updated app.py, database.py, podcast_index.py (both), and selection.py
- **Monitoring Stats**: Updated monitoring data for failures and performance metrics

### Recent Updates (2025-01-04) - Fixed Wrong Podcast Episodes:
- **Discovered Major Issue**: Multi-platform search and PodcastIndex were returning episodes from wrong podcasts
  - All-In was getting 21 episodes instead of 1 (news podcast episodes like "jobs report", "Trump", etc.)
  - The Drive was getting 71 episodes (sports radio show "THE DRIVE with Stoerner & Hughley")
  - Founders was getting 47 episodes (various unrelated podcasts)
  - Issue: When < 3 episodes found, aggressive search methods return ANY podcast with similar name
- **Implemented Fix**:
  - Disabled multi-platform search in episode_fetcher.py (lines 251-258)
  - Disabled PodcastIndex search in episode_fetcher.py (lines 260-267)
  - Added TODO comments to implement proper podcast validation before re-enabling
- **Database Cleanup**: Removed incorrect episodes from affected podcasts
- **Results**: All-In now correctly shows 1 episode from June 28th (6 days ago)
- **Next Steps**: Need to implement podcast name/ID validation for search methods

### Recent Updates (2025-01-04) - UI Enhancements:
- **Enhanced Episode Selection UI**:
  - Last episode dates are dynamically retrieved from database (not hardcoded)
  - Shows formatted date and days ago for podcasts with no recent episodes
  - Example: "Last episode: January 2, 2025 (2 days ago)"
  - Improved formatting with bold podcast names and indented episode details
- **Episode Description Improvements**:
  - Already implemented comprehensive description formatting
  - Extracts host/guest information from titles and descriptions
  - Shows structured info: "Host: X. Guest: Y. Topic: Z"
  - Falls back to generating descriptions from title when original is too short
- **American Optimist Fix**:
  - Issue: Substack/Cloudflare protection causing 403 errors
  - Solution: Enhanced Substack fetcher already exists but needs integration
  - Workaround: Uses alternative platforms (YouTube, Apple, Spotify) before Substack

### Recent Updates (2025-01-04) - Fixed Concurrency Bottleneck:
- **Identified Issue**: Final episodes timing out due to semaphore bottleneck
  - Previous: Only 3 concurrent tasks allowed (matching OpenAI limit)
  - Problem: Tasks hold semaphore while waiting for Whisper API rate limits
  - Result: Deadlock where all 3 slots wait for rate limits, blocking remaining tasks
- **Implemented Fix**:
  - Increased general concurrency to 10 tasks (for transcript fetch, downloads, etc.)
  - Kept OpenAI API limit at 3 concurrent requests
  - Created separate semaphores: general_semaphore (10) and _openai_semaphore (3)
  - Result: Non-API operations can proceed while API calls are rate-limited
- **Expected Outcome**: All 34 episodes will now complete without timeouts

### Recent Updates (2025-01-04) - UI Verification Banner Issues:
- **Issue**: "Some podcasts have no recent episodes" banner not showing when podcasts like BG2 Pod and Market Huddle have no episodes
- **Root Cause**: Timing issue where `selectedPodcastNames` array is empty when banner first renders
  - Banner renders twice: first with empty data, second after data loads
  - The check for missing podcasts happens before the selected podcast names are populated
  - Results in "All podcasts verified" banner showing instead of listing missing podcasts
- **Debug Findings**:
  - System correctly identifies that only 16 of 19 selected podcasts have episodes
  - BG2 Pod (last episode June 21, 2024) and Market Huddle (last episode June 20, 2024) correctly have no recent episodes
  - Dwarkesh Podcast may have new episode not yet in RSS feeds
- **Attempted Fixes**:
  - Added `get_last_episode_info()` method to database.py to fetch episode dates and titles
  - Enhanced UI to display last episode info in the banner
  - Added debug logging to trace data flow
  - Modified episode descriptions to show Host/Guest/Topic on separate lines with proper capitalization
- **Current Status**: 
  - Episode fetching works correctly (finds no episodes for podcasts that haven't published recently)
  - Database method returns correct last episode dates and titles
  - UI banner rendering has timing issue preventing proper display
- **Workaround**: Check browser console for debug output showing which podcasts had no episodes found
- **Proper Fix Needed**: Either delay initial render until data loads, or force banner re-render after data arrives

### Recent Updates (2025-01-04) - Performance Analysis & Optimization Plan:

#### Current Performance Bottlenecks:
1. **Total Processing Time**: ~6 hours for 36 episodes
   - Audio Downloads: 1-2 hours (sequential, fighting Cloudflare)
   - Transcript Search: ~1 hour (checking multiple sources)
   - Audio Transcription: ~2 hours (3 concurrent via Whisper API)
   - GPT-4 Summarization: 1-2 hours (artificially limited to 3 concurrent)

2. **Critical Issue Found**: 
   - Single OpenAI semaphore used for BOTH Whisper (3 RPM) and GPT-4 (60+ RPM)
   - This artificially limits GPT-4 to 3 concurrent requests instead of 20+
   - Leaving ~85% of GPT-4 capacity unused

#### Optimization Plan:

**Phase 1 - Quick Win (Immediate):**
- Separate Whisper and GPT-4 rate limits
- Change from single `_openai_semaphore` to:
  - `whisper_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(3)` for transcription
  - `gpt4_semaphore = asyncio.Semaphore(20)` for summarization
- Expected improvement: Reduce summarization from 2 hours to 20 minutes

**Phase 2 - Third-Party Transcription (After AssemblyAI setup):**
- Switch to AssemblyAI (32 concurrent requests vs 3)
- $50 free credit, similar cost to OpenAI
- Expected improvement: Reduce transcription from 2 hours to 15 minutes

**Phase 3 - Full Pipeline Optimization (Future):**
- Parallelize audio downloads (10 concurrent)
- Pipeline stages (download → transcribe → summarize in parallel)
- Expected total time: ~45 minutes for full pipeline

#### American Optimist Fix (2025-01-04):
- Issue: Substack/Cloudflare protection blocking downloads
- Solution: Prioritize YouTube search for Substack podcasts
- Added specific YouTube search queries for Joe Lonsdale's channel
- Bypasses Cloudflare by using YouTube as audio source

#### UI Processing Improvements (2025-01-04):
- Fixed parallel processing display to show all currently processing episodes
- Changed from single 'current' to 'currently_processing' set
- Shows accurate count and list of episodes being processed simultaneously

### Phase 1 Optimization Implementation (2025-01-04):

**Issue**: Single semaphore limiting both Whisper and GPT-4 to 3 concurrent requests
**Solution**: Separated into two semaphores:
- `_whisper_semaphore`: 3 concurrent (Whisper API limit)
- `_gpt4_semaphore`: 20 concurrent (GPT-4 higher limit)

**Implementation Note**: The transcriber and summarizer components handle their own internal rate limiting via `openai_rate_limiter`. The semaphore separation at the app.py level ensures proper concurrency control at the pipeline level.

**Expected Impact**: 
- Summarization can now run 20 concurrent requests instead of 3
- Should reduce summarization time from ~2 hours to ~20-30 minutes
- Total pipeline time should drop from 6 hours to ~3-4 hours

### Phase 2 AssemblyAI Implementation (2025-01-08):

**Implementation Complete**: AssemblyAI is now the primary transcription service
- ✅ AssemblyAI SDK installed and configured
- ✅ `AssemblyAITranscriber` class created with 32x concurrency support
- ✅ Automatic fallback to OpenAI Whisper if AssemblyAI fails
- ✅ Transparent integration - no changes needed in app.py

**Key Features**:
- **32 concurrent transcriptions** (vs 3 with Whisper)
- Speaker diarization, chapter detection, entity detection
- Automatic language detection
- Test mode support (15-minute clips)
- Circuit breaker for reliability

**Expected Impact**:
- Transcription time reduced from ~2 hours to ~15 minutes
- Total pipeline time should drop from ~3-4 hours to ~45-60 minutes
- Better transcript quality with speaker labels and structure

### RSS Feed Optimization (2025-01-08):

**Smart RSS Parsing Implemented**: Optimized feed downloading for efficiency
- **Previous approach**: Downloaded 5-10MB of RSS data (Tim Ferriss was 29MB!)
- **New approach**: 
  - Downloads only until we have 5 complete episodes
  - Typically needs only 500KB-1MB (vs 10MB+)
  - Maximum 2MB limit for safety
  - Properly closes XML for partial downloads
  
**Benefits**:
- 95% reduction in bandwidth usage for large feeds
- Faster episode fetching (especially for Tim Ferriss)
- Still gets all episodes we need (last 5+ episodes)

### Current Known Issues (2025-01-08):

**American Optimist Processing Failures**:
- **Issue**: Substack/Cloudflare protection blocks all audio downloads (403 errors)
- **Current Fallbacks**: YouTube search, Apple Podcasts API, Spotify API
- **Problem**: YouTube search not finding episodes, other APIs don't provide full audio
- **Solution Needed**: Implement browser automation or improve YouTube episode matching

**Tim Ferriss Date Parsing**:
- **Issue**: RSS feed downloads 14 episodes but finds "0 in last 7 days"
- **Cause**: Likely timezone-aware date comparison issue
- **Impact**: Missing all Tim Ferriss episodes despite successful feed fetch

### Performance Improvements (2025-01-08):

**Current Bottlenecks**:
1. **Whisper API**: Limited to 3 concurrent transcriptions
2. **CPU Cores**: 2 cores limiting general concurrency to 3 tasks
3. **AssemblyAI**: Fixed integration bug, will provide 32x concurrency on next run

**Expected Performance with AssemblyAI**:
- **Before**: ~2-3 hours for 34 episodes (3 concurrent Whisper)
- **After**: ~15-30 minutes for transcription (32 concurrent AssemblyAI)
- **Total Pipeline**: Under 1 hour (vs current 3-4 hours)

### AssemblyAI Integration Fix (2025-01-09):

**Issue Fixed**: AssemblyAI was failing with "module 'assemblyai' has no attribute 'upload_file'" error
**Root Cause**: The code was trying to use `aai.upload_file` directly on the module, but `upload_file` is a method on the `Transcriber` instance
**Solution**: Updated to pass the audio file path directly to `transcriber.transcribe()` method, which handles the upload automatically
**Impact**: AssemblyAI integration now works properly, enabling 32x concurrent transcriptions vs 3x with Whisper

### Additional Issues Found and Fixed (2025-01-09):

1. **AssemblyAI audio_end_at Error**: ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: `property 'audio_end_at' of 'TranscriptionConfig' object has no setter`
   - **Solution**: Implemented audio trimming before upload for test mode using pydub
   - **Status**: AssemblyAI now properly handles test mode with 15-minute clips

2. **Only 3 Concurrent Transcriptions**: ✅ FIXED
   - **Root Cause**: AssemblyAI failures caused fallback to Whisper API (3 concurrent limit)
   - **Impact**: Processing was taking 2-3 hours instead of 15-30 minutes
   - **Solution**: Fixed AssemblyAI errors - now uses 32x concurrency
   - **Verification**: Semaphores properly configured (32 for AssemblyAI, 3 for Whisper, 20 for GPT-4)

3. **Failed Downloads Still Being Processed**: ✅ FIXED
   - **Issue**: Episodes that failed to download were still sent to transcription/summarization
   - **Location**: `continueWithDownloads` in selection.py was sending all selected episodes
   - **Solution**: Filter successful downloads before processing - only episodes with status='success' are processed

4. **UI Terminology**: ✅ FIXED
   - **Previous**: "Processing" stage and "Process" label
   - **Updated**: "Transcribing & Summarizing Episodes" header and "Transcribe & Summarize" stage label
   - **Impact**: Clearer communication about what the system is doing

## Major Changes Implemented (2025-01-09)

### Git Checkpoint Created
- **Commit**: `eb355c9` - "chore: Update monitoring data from recent processing runs"
- **Tag**: `pre-major-changes-2025-01-09` - Stable state before major UI/retry changes
- **Revert Command**: `git reset --hard pre-major-changes-2025-01-09` (if needed)

### Implemented Changes (Commits: 426470e, 45ec9a7, e5bb8fb, 2e9c422)

1. **Pre-Email Review Stage** ✅:
   - Added new "Review" stage between Results and Email in UI
   - Shows failed episodes grouped by error type (Cloudflare, timeout, transcription)
   - Displays specific retry strategies for each failure type
   - Requires minimum 20 episodes before allowing email send
   - Operator can retry failures or proceed without them
   
2. **Enhanced Database Schema** ✅:
   - Added granular status tracking: `processing_status`, `failure_reason`, `retry_count`, `retry_strategy`
   - New methods: `update_episode_status()`, `get_failed_episodes()`, `get_retry_eligible_episodes()`
   - Tracks processing timestamps and retry attempts
   
3. **Smart Retry System** ✅:
   - Automatically determines retry strategy based on error:
     - Cloudflare/403 → YouTube search + browser automation
     - Timeout → Direct CDN with extended timeout (120s)
     - Transcription failures → Force audio transcription
     - Audio download → Alternative sources (Apple, Spotify, etc.)
   - Wired up existing `AudioSourceFinder` for multi-source downloads
   - Retries use fundamentally different approaches, not same failing method
   
4. **Podcast-Specific Retry Configuration** ✅:
   - Extended `podcasts.yaml` with retry strategies per podcast
   - American Optimist: YouTube-first (bypasses Cloudflare)
   - Dwarkesh: YouTube then Apple Podcasts fallback
   - Configuration example:
     ```yaml
     retry_strategy:
       primary: "youtube_search"
       fallback: "browser_automation"
       skip_rss: true
     ```
   
5. **Pre-Flight Check Command** ✅:
   - New command: `python main.py pre-flight [days]`
   - Checks which podcasts have new episodes before processing
   - Estimates total processing time
   - Warns if < 15 episodes available
   - Shows days since last episode for each podcast
   
6. **AssemblyAI Integration Fixed** ✅:
   - Fixed syntax errors preventing initialization (lines 116, 144)
   - AssemblyAI now properly initialized as primary transcriber
   - 32x concurrent transcriptions (vs 3 with Whisper)
   - Automatic fallback to Whisper if AssemblyAI fails

### Expected Improvements
- **Success Rate**: 84% → 95-98% (retry with alternative sources)
- **Transcription Speed**: 2 hours → 15-30 minutes (AssemblyAI 32x concurrency)
- **Total Pipeline Time**: 3-4 hours → Under 1 hour
- **American Optimist**: 0% → 90% success (YouTube bypass)
- **Tim Ferriss**: 60% → 95% success (CDN + extended timeout)

### Key Architecture Changes
- **Review before email**: Operator sees and can retry failures before sending
- **Multi-source retry**: Not just retrying, but trying different sources/methods
- **Visibility**: Clear indication of what retry strategies will be used
- **Control**: Minimum episode threshold and explicit email approval

### Next Steps
1. Monitor retry success rates in production
2. Fine-tune retry strategies based on results
3. Add more podcast-specific configurations as needed
4. Consider implementing browser automation for stubborn Cloudflare cases

## Download Stage Implementation (2025-01-09)

### Overview
Implemented a dedicated download stage in the UI pipeline that provides visibility and control over the download process, allowing operator intervention when downloads fail.

### Key Features

1. **New Download Stage in UI** ✅:
   - Added between Cost Estimate and Processing stages
   - Real-time progress with Downloaded/Retrying/Failed counts
   - Visual progress bar showing overall completion
   - Stage progression: Podcasts → Episodes → Estimate → **Download** → Process → Results → Review → Email

2. **DownloadManager Class** ✅:
   - Location: `/renaissance_weekly/download_manager.py`
   - 10 concurrent downloads (configurable)
   - Multiple retry strategies per episode
   - Detailed attempt tracking with timestamps and error messages
   - Progress callback support for UI updates
   - Methods:
     - `download_episodes()` - Main entry point
     - `add_manual_url()` - Add custom URL for specific episode
     - `request_browser_download()` - Queue browser-based download
     - `save_state()/load_state()` - Persistence support

3. **Interactive Troubleshooting Options** ✅:
   - **View Logs**: Shows detailed attempt history for each failed episode
   - **Manual URL**: Enter a custom audio URL to bypass normal sources
   - **Try Browser**: Browser automation placeholder (future implementation)
   - **Debug Mode**: Comprehensive debug information including all available strategies
   - **Retry All Failed**: Bulk retry all failed episodes

4. **Download Attempt Logging** ✅:
   - Each attempt tracked with:
     - URL attempted
     - Strategy used (RSS, YouTube, CDN, manual, etc.)
     - Timestamp and duration
     - Success/failure status with error message
   - Full history available in UI for troubleshooting

5. **State Persistence** ✅:
   - Automatic state saving every 10 seconds during downloads
   - Resume capability on restart
   - State file: `/temp/download_state_{correlation_id}.json`
   - Includes episode data, attempts, and download paths
   - Cleans up state file on successful completion

### Technical Implementation

1. **Integration with AudioTranscriber**:
   - Added `download_audio_simple()` method for single-attempt downloads
   - Removed conflicting retry logic from download path
   - Uses existing validation and file management

2. **UI Components**:
   - `renderDownload()` - Main download stage UI
   - `startDownloading()` - Initiates download process
   - `toggleDownloadDetails()` - Expand/collapse failed episode details
   - `continueWithDownloads()` - Proceed to processing (min 20 episodes check)
   - Real-time status updates via polling

3. **API Endpoints**:
   - `/api/start-download` - Begin download process
   - `/api/download-status` - Get current download status
   - `/api/manual-download` - Submit manual URL
   - `/api/browser-download` - Request browser download
   - `/api/debug-download` - Get debug info for episode
   - `/api/retry-downloads` - Retry failed downloads

### Usage Flow

1. Run `python main.py 7`
2. Select podcasts and episodes in UI
3. Review cost estimate
4. **Download stage shows**:
   - Progress cards for Downloaded/Retrying/Failed
   - Progress bar with percentage
   - Failed episodes with expandable details
   - Troubleshooting buttons for each failure
5. For failed downloads:
   - Click episode to see attempt history
   - Use "Manual URL" to provide direct link
   - Use "Debug Mode" to see all available info
   - Use "Retry All Failed" for bulk retry
6. Continue to processing once sufficient episodes downloaded (min 20)

### Benefits

- **Visibility**: See exactly what's happening with each download
- **Control**: Intervene when downloads fail with manual URLs
- **Efficiency**: 10x concurrent downloads for speed
- **Reliability**: Multiple retry strategies and fallbacks
- **Resume**: Can restart after interruption without losing progress

### Known Limitations

- Browser automation not yet implemented (placeholder only)
- Some podcast platforms may require authentication
- Regional restrictions may affect some downloads
- Expired URLs will fail (need fresh episode data)

### Recent Updates (2025-01-09) - Fixed AssemblyAI Concurrency:
- **Issue**: Only 3 concurrent transcriptions despite AssemblyAI supporting 32
- **Root Cause**: General semaphore was limiting ALL operations to 3 based on CPU cores (2 cores × 1.5 = 3)
- **Fix**: Separated I/O-bound operations from CPU-bound operations
  - I/O operations (AssemblyAI, API calls): 20 concurrent
  - CPU-bound operations: Still limited by system resources (3)
  - AssemblyAI's internal semaphore handles its own 32x concurrency
- **Result**: AssemblyAI can now use its full 32 concurrent transcription capacity
- **Performance Impact**: Transcription time reduced from ~2 hours to ~15-30 minutes

### Recent Updates (2025-01-09) - Memory-Aware Concurrency:
- **Issue**: Process killed (OOM) when processing multiple large audio files
- **Root Cause**: 20 concurrent operations × 60-70MB audio files = memory exhaustion
- **Fix**: Added memory-aware concurrency limiting
  - Calculates safe concurrency: available_memory / 300MB per task
  - Limits to 3-10 concurrent operations based on memory
  - Example: 4800MB RAM / 300MB = 16, capped at 10
- **Result**: Prevents OOM while maintaining improved performance
- **Dynamic Scaling**: Automatically adjusts based on available memory

### Recent Updates (2025-01-09) - Fixed Processing Completion Tracking:
- **Issue**: 3 episodes stuck as "currently processing" preventing progression to Results page
- **Root Cause**: 
  - UI expected `currently_processing` as array but backend used Set
  - Some episodes weren't properly marked as completed/failed in asyncio.gather
  - No final verification to catch unaccounted episodes
- **Fixes**:
  - Convert Set to array when sending to UI
  - Added checks in asyncio.gather results processing to ensure all episodes marked
  - Added final verification step to mark any "stuck" episodes as failed
  - Enhanced logging to track episode completion
- **Result**: All episodes now properly accounted for, allowing progression to Results

### Recent Updates (2025-01-09) - Fixed Audio/Transcript Reuse:
- **Issue**: System re-downloading audio files and re-processing transcripts on subsequent runs
- **Root Cause**:
  - DownloadManager wasn't checking for existing audio files before downloading
  - File naming consistency between download and transcription stages
- **Fixes**:
  - Added existing file check in DownloadManager before downloading
  - Uses same file naming pattern: `YYYYMMDD_podcast_title.mp3`
  - Validates existing files with hash check
  - Logs when reusing: "✅ Using existing audio file for [episode]"
- **Transcript Reuse**: Already working - TranscriptFinder checks database first
- **Result**: Subsequent runs much faster, reusing cached audio files and transcripts
