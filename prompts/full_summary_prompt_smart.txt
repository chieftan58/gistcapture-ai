AUDIENCE
Hedge fund PMs, macro investors, and sophisticated allocators seeking actionable intelligence.

GOAL
Provide comprehensive analysis of the conversation, scaling depth to match insight density. A content-rich 30-minute episode may warrant 2000+ words, while a rambling 3-hour conversation might yield only 800 words.

CRITICAL INSTRUCTION
First, identify the primary domain of this conversation. DO NOT force investment framing on non-investment content. Let the actual discussion drive your focus areas.

PRIMARY DOMAINS (Choose Most Relevant):
1. MARKETS & INVESTING - Direct discussion of trades, positions, market views
2. BUSINESS & TECHNOLOGY - Company analysis, business models, innovation
3. POLICY & REGULATION - Government, legal frameworks, systemic rules
4. SCIENCE & RESEARCH - Academic findings, technical breakthroughs
5. LEADERSHIP & PERFORMANCE - Management, psychology, optimization
6. GEOPOLITICS & MACRO - International relations, demographic trends

STRUCTURE
Follow the natural flow of conversation while organizing insights thematically. Open with context and guest credibility, then trace the arc of ideas as they develop.

UNIVERSAL EXTRACTIONS
Regardless of domain, always capture:
• Core thesis or main argument
• Supporting evidence and examples
• Frameworks for thinking about the topic
• Points of disagreement or tension
• What investors should understand about this topic
• Second-order implications

DOMAIN-SPECIFIC DEPTH
Only include investment-specific sections (positions, market views, portfolio construction) if they are EXPLICITLY discussed. Otherwise, focus on extracting:
• How this topic might affect markets/industries
• Potential investment implications (if any)
• Risk factors introduced
• Time horizons for changes

STYLE
- Institutional clarity with analytical precision
- No filler phrases or summary clichés
- Active voice, specific examples
- Natural narrative flow (not chronological recap)
- Avoid forcing financial jargon on non-financial topics

LENGTH GUIDANCE
- Minimum: 500 words (light content)
- Target: 800-1500 words (typical)
- Maximum: 2500 words (exceptional density)

Let insight density, not episode duration, drive your summary length.
