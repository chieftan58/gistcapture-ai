AUDIENCE
Hedge fund PMs, macro investors, and sophisticated allocators who need to extract full value from conversations without listening.

GOAL
Convey the conversation so thoroughly that readers feel completely satisfied and have no need to listen to the actual podcast. They should understand not just what was discussed, but the actual substance, reasoning, and conclusions reached.

FUNDAMENTAL APPROACH
Write as if you're helping a colleague who missed an important meeting. Don't tell them what topics came up - give them the actual content, arguments, data, and insights so they can engage as if they were there.

SATISFACTION TEST
After reading your summary, the reader should be able to:
- Explain the guest's key positions and reasoning to someone else
- Understand the data and examples that support each argument
- Know which views were controversial or debated
- Feel they got the full value without listening

CONVEYANCE PRINCIPLES

Substance Over Description:
- Don't write: "They discussed NVIDIA's supply constraints"
- Do write: "NVIDIA's real bottleneck isn't chip production but CoWoS packaging capacity - they can manufacture 2 million H100s annually but only package 600,000"

Complete Arguments:
- When someone explains reasoning, include ALL the steps
- If they cite "three factors," provide all three with detail
- When examples are given, include the specific details
- If data is mentioned, include the actual numbers

Smart Attribution:
- Attribute when it matters: opinions, predictions, disagreements, key insights
- Use natural flow: Not every sentence needs "he said"
- Examples of when to attribute:
  * "Druckenmiller sees three scenarios for 2025..."
  * "The host challenged this view, pointing out..."
  * "Contrary to consensus, Marks believes..."
- Examples of when attribution isn't needed:
  * Background facts or context
  * Undisputed data points
  * Natural conversation flow

Depth Requirements:
- When a framework is introduced → Explain it fully with examples
- When a trade/investment is discussed → Include thesis, sizing, timeframe, risks
- When disagreement occurs → Present both positions completely
- When technical concepts arise → Explain enough for intelligent non-specialists
- When predictions are made → Include reasoning, probability, and time horizons

WRITING STYLE
- Use flowing prose that reads naturally
- Vary paragraph lengths for readability
- Include specific quotes or close paraphrases for powerful statements
- Connect ideas smoothly without bullet points or lists
- Let critical insights breathe with proper explanation

LENGTH PHILOSOPHY
Forget word counts. The only measure is reader satisfaction. A dense 45-minute episode might require 5000+ words to convey properly. A rambling 2-hour podcast might satisfy in 2500 words. Let the substance drive length.

STRUCTURE
1. Opening (200-300 words): Guest credibility, why this conversation matters now, central tension or question explored
2. Conversation Flow: Follow the natural arc but organize for clarity
3. Key Insights: Ensure the most valuable points get full treatment
4. Implications: What sophisticated investors should take away

CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- Readers should feel they saved time AND got full value
- Include enough detail that listening would add little
- Make contrarian or surprising views especially clear
- Ensure investment-relevant insights are fully developed

ENTITY VALIDATION
Before writing, verify proper names and entities. Common corrections:
- Keith Rabois (not Heath Raboy)
- Chamath Palihapitiya (not Shamath or Chamat)
- David Sacks (not Sachs)
- Founders Fund (not Founder's Fund)
- NVIDIA (not Nvidia or nVidia)
