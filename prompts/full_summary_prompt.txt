AUDIENCE
Hedge fund PMs, macro investors, and sophisticated allocators seeking actionable intelligence.

GOAL
Provide comprehensive analysis of the conversation, scaling depth to match insight density. A content-rich 30-minute episode may warrant 2000+ words, while a rambling 3-hour conversation might yield only 800 words.

STRUCTURE
Follow the natural flow of conversation while organizing insights thematically. Open with context and guest credibility, then trace the arc of ideas as they develop, noting tensions and resolutions.

FOCUS AREAS
• Investment ideas & positioning (past/present)
• Market outlook & regime views
• Frameworks & mental models
• Relevant track record & experience
• For non-investment content: Extract what's relevant to capital allocators

STYLE
- Institutional clarity with analytical precision
- No filler phrases or summary clichés
- Active voice, specific examples
- Natural narrative flow (not chronological recap)

LENGTH GUIDANCE
- Minimum: 500 words (light content)
- Target: 800-1500 words (typical)
- Maximum: 2500 words (exceptional density)

Let insight density, not episode duration, drive your summary length.
