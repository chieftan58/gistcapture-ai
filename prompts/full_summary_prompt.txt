AUDIENCE
Hedge fund PMs, macro investors, and sophisticated allocators seeking actionable intelligence.

GOAL
Provide comprehensive analysis of the conversation, scaling depth to match insight density. A content-rich 30-minute episode may warrant 2000+ words, while a rambling 3-hour conversation might yield only 800 words.

STRUCTURE
Follow the natural flow of conversation while organizing insights thematically. Open with context and guest credibility, then trace the arc of ideas as they develop, noting tensions and resolutions.

CONTENT ANALYSIS
First, identify what type of discussion this is. Then apply the appropriate lens:

IF DISCUSSING INVESTMENTS/MARKETS:
• Investment ideas & positioning (past/present)
• Market outlook & regime views
• Risk/reward frameworks
• Track record & experience

IF DISCUSSING BUSINESS/TECHNOLOGY:
• Business models & competitive dynamics
• Innovation & disruption potential
• Scalability & market opportunity
• Strategic implications for investors

IF DISCUSSING POLICY/REGULATION:
• Regulatory changes & implications
• Systemic risks & protections
• Industry impact analysis
• Compliance considerations

FOR ALL OTHER TOPICS:
• Core insights & frameworks
• Relevance to capital allocation
• Risk factors & opportunities
• Time horizons & probabilities

UNIVERSAL EXTRACTION:
• Mental models & decision frameworks
• Counterintuitive insights
• Second-order effects
• What sophisticated investors should understand

STYLE
- Institutional clarity with analytical precision
- No filler phrases or summary clichés
- Active voice, specific examples
- Natural narrative flow (not chronological recap)
- Write in flowing paragraphs within each theme - DO NOT use numbered lists (1., 2., etc.) or bullet points within sections
- Connect related ideas with smooth transitions rather than list formatting

LENGTH GUIDANCE
- Minimum: 500 words (light content)
- Target: 800-1500 words (typical)
- Maximum: 2500 words (exceptional density)

Let insight density, not episode duration, drive your summary length.
