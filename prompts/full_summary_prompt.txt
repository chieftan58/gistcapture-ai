AUDIENCE
Hedge fund PMs, macro investors, and sophisticated allocators seeking to understand how experts think about complex topics.

GOAL
Provide deep exploration of the topics discussed, capturing the nuances of how participants think about each subject. Scale depth to match the richness of discussion, not just episode length.

TOPIC MAPPING
Before writing, identify the 3-6 main topics explored in the episode. Topics might include:
• A specific company, investment opportunity, or market dynamic
• A technology trend, business model, or industry analysis  
• An economic theme, policy development, or regulatory change
• A framework, mental model, or analytical approach
• Historical parallels, case studies, or lessons learned

Note which topics received the most time and generated the richest discussion.

TOPIC EXPLORATION FRAMEWORK
For each major topic, capture:

The Discussion Arc:
- How was the topic introduced and why?
- What facts, data points, or evidence were cited?
- How did different participants approach the topic?
- What questions were raised and how were they addressed?
- Where did the discussion lead? Any conclusions or open questions?

The Granular Details:
- Specific numbers, dates, names, and examples mentioned
- Analogies or frameworks used to explain concepts
- Areas where participants agreed or disagreed
- Moments of uncertainty or speculation ("I think...", "Maybe...")
- How ideas built upon each other through the conversation

DEPTH TRIGGERS
When participants engage in these ways, expand your coverage:
• Explaining their reasoning → Capture the complete logical chain
• Providing specific examples → Include them and what they illustrate
• Building on each other's ideas → Show the intellectual progression
• Expressing disagreement → Present both positions with supporting logic
• Going technical → Explain enough for an intelligent non-specialist
• Citing research or data → Include the specifics and implications

WRITING APPROACH
- Follow the natural flow of how topics emerged and evolved
- Show the back-and-forth when participants build on ideas
- Include "thinking out loud" moments that reveal thought processes
- Note when views are refined or minds changed during discussion
- Let the conversation's energy guide emphasis - spend more words on topics that sparked engagement

STYLE
- Write in flowing paragraphs that follow the discussion's natural rhythm
- Avoid bullet points or numbered lists within topic sections
- Use clear topic headers to organize major themes
- Connect related ideas with smooth transitions
- Include enough context so readers can follow complex arguments
- Don't force investment implications - let them emerge naturally from the discussion

LENGTH GUIDANCE - TOPIC DRIVEN
Let the number and richness of topics drive length:
- 2-3 light topics: 1000-1500 words
- 3-4 substantive topics: 1500-2500 words  
- 5+ topics with rich discussion: 2500-4000 words

Each major topic typically warrants 300-600 words depending on:
- How much time participants spent on it
- The depth of analysis provided
- The number of perspectives shared
- The complexity of the subject matter

Remember: A 30-minute episode with deep exploration of 2 topics deserves more words than a 3-hour surface-level conversation.

STRUCTURE
1. Opening Context (100-200 words): Guest background, why this conversation matters now
2. Topic Sections (300-600 words each): Deep exploration of each major theme
3. Synthesis (optional, 100-200 words): Only if participants explicitly connected themes

Focus on helping readers understand not just what was discussed, but how sophisticated thinkers approach and explore these subjects.

ENTITY VALIDATION

- Keith Rabois (not Heath Raboy)
