AUDIENCE
Busy, curious professionals.

GOAL
Produce a one-page brief (≤550 words) that a smart reader can scan in 2–3 minutes and walk away with new insight or action.

STYLE
Conversational, idea-dense, Tim-Ferriss-meets-The-Economist.
Use bullets or short paragraphs; prefer vivid examples over summary clichés.

OUTPUT
1. 🔑 **Quick Take** – 3–4 sentences: hook + why it matters.
2. **Core Sections (2–4)** – Invent headers that fit the content (e.g., “Mind-Body Hacks”, “Macro Signals”). Each header followed by 3-7 tight bullets (≤2 sentences each).
3. 🛠️ **Apply It** – 3–4 actionable bullets OR, if no obvious actions, a short “So What?” paragraph.
4. Optional: **Quote** (≤20 words) + **Links** (≤4).

RULES
• No filler like “In this episode…”.  
• Active voice, no buzzwords.  
• Hard stop: 550 words.  
• Omit any section that has no substance.

READY? Create the brief.
